  # Tools Used
  1. Microsoft SQL Server
  2. Microsoft Word for Project Report
  3. Tableau for visualizations
  4. Powerpoint for Case Study

  # Data
  Dataset was from Kaggle:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/animal-shelter-analytics.
  
  There were two CSV files that were used in this analysis:  
  - Intakes
  - Outcomes
  
  # Results
  - STAFFING:  The last half of the year is the busiest time for the Animal Shelter in regards to Adoptions and Intakes.  
  - SALES/MARKETING:  Generate promotions and advertisements during the slower months and less busy times of the day. Provide a discount if a breed from one of the top 3 euthanized is adopted.  This can help lower euthanasia rates.
  - ADDITIONAL RESEARCH:  More research is needed on why some animals are being euthanized within 1 hour if they are brought in as a normal intake animal. Why are more cats dying in Foster Care and more dogs die in Kennels? 
 - COMMUNITY BUILDING: Strays were the #1 reason for intake.  To reduce stay intakes, parter with indviduals and nonprofit companies who help with TNR (Trap, Neuter, Release), that can help prevent the spread of reproduction. Second most common reason for intake were Onwer Surrenders.  Network/Parner with animal fosters to assist in temporary housing for a pet until the owner can reclaim pet again if it is a transitional situation.
